# PowerShell Resources

Here's a small collection of resources I've found particularly useful in writing PowerShell scripts for Azure, Exchange and O365 Administration.

[Repo](https://github.com/damitasalmon/shell-scripts/tree/main/powershell) where some of those scripts are saved. 

#### Resources

[Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps)<br />
[MorganTechSpace - Office 365 | Azure AD | Articles, FAQs, Scripts](https://morgantechspace.com/)<br />
[SharePoint Diary - Salaudeen Rajack's SharePoint Experiences!](https://www.sharepointdiary.com/)
