# Backups 3-2-1 rule 

The 3-2-1 rule specifies that:

You should always keep at least **three** up-to-date copies of your data; this can include the original copy, but all copies must be maintained.

Backups should be stored on at least **two** different storage mediums, e.g., a cloud backup and an external hard drive or USB drive. This can include a hard drive on your PC.

**One** (or more) backups should be stored "off-site". Cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Mega could be used for personal use.
