# Welcome to my notes

Mostly for my own searchable reference, written from my own blistering experience.
Advice (for myself), write-ups of my labs, exercises, projects and any other helpful documentation I've used. 

>Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. 
 
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. <br />
Maybe you'll need them, maybe you wont. <br />

If you find these pages, rambling and incoherent, be patient. <br />
Especially, if you're me. <br />
