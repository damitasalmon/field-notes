# Welcome to my notes

Mostly for my own searchable reference, written from my own blistering experience.
Advice (for myself), write-ups of my labs, projects and any other helpful documentation I've used. 

>Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. 

Restart your computer. 
  
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, restarting would be it. The long-term benefits of restarts have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now:
  
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. <br />
Maybe you'll need them, maybe you wont. <br />
Maybe these notes will help you, maybe they won't. <br />
Maybe you'll use Google, maybe you'll go in a different direction entirely. <br />

Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. <br /> 
Especially if you find these pages, rambling and incoherent. <br />
Especially if you're me. <br />

But trust me on the restart. 
<br />

Brownie points if you catch this reference without Google.
